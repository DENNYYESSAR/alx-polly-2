# ALX Polly: A Polling Application

Welcome to ALX Polly, a full-stack polling application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase. This project serves as a practical learning ground for modern web development concepts, with a special focus on identifying and fixing common security vulnerabilities.

## About the Application

ALX Polly allows authenticated users to create, share, and vote on polls. It's a simple yet powerful application that demonstrates key features of modern web development:

-   **Authentication**: Secure user sign-up and login.
-   **Poll Management**: Users can create, view, and delete their own polls.
-   **Voting System**: A straightforward system for casting and viewing votes.
-   **User Dashboard**: A personalized space for users to manage their polls.

The application is built with a modern tech stack:

-   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **Backend & Database**: [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)
-   **UI**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
-   **State Management**: React Server Components and Client Components

## ðŸš€ The Challenge: Security Audit & Remediation

As a developer, writing functional code is only half the battle. Ensuring that the code is secure, robust, and free of vulnerabilities is just as critical. This version of ALX Polly has been intentionally built with several security flaws, providing a real-world scenario for you to practice your security auditing skills.

**Your mission is to act as a security engineer tasked with auditing this codebase.**

### Your Objectives:

1.  **Identify Vulnerabilities**:
    -   Thoroughly review the codebase to find security weaknesses.
    -   Pay close attention to user authentication, data access, and business logic.
    -   Think about how a malicious actor could misuse the application's features.

2.  **Understand the Impact**:
    -   For each vulnerability you find, determine the potential impact.Query your AI assistant about it. What data could be exposed? What unauthorized actions could be performed?

3.  **Propose and Implement Fixes**:
    -   Once a vulnerability is identified, ask your AI assistant to fix it.
    -   Write secure, efficient, and clean code to patch the security holes.
    -   Ensure that your fixes do not break existing functionality for legitimate users.

### Where to Start?

A good security audit involves both static code analysis and dynamic testing. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1.  **Familiarize Yourself with the Code**:
    -   Start with `app/lib/actions/` to understand how the application interacts with the database.
    -   Explore the page routes in the `app/(dashboard)/` directory. How is data displayed and managed?
    -   Look for hidden or undocumented features. Are there any pages not linked in the main UI?

2.  **Use Your AI Assistant**:
    -   This is an open-book test. You are encouraged to use AI tools to help you.
    -   Ask your AI assistant to review snippets of code for security issues.
    -   Describe a feature's behavior to your AI and ask it to identify potential attack vectors.
    -   When you find a vulnerability, ask your AI for the best way to patch it.

## Getting Started

To begin your security audit, you'll need to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.x or higher recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   A [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) account (the project is pre-configured, but you may need your own for a clean slate).

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd alx-polly
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

The project uses Supabase for its backend. An environment file `.env.local` is needed.Use the keys you created during the Supabase setup process.

### 4. Running the Development Server

Start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Good luck, engineer! This is your chance to step into the shoes of a security professional and make a real impact on the quality and safety of this application. Happy hunting!

## Security Audit Findings and Fixes

During the security audit, the following vulnerabilities were identified and subsequently remediated:

### 1. Client-side Redirect after Login

*   **Location:** `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` and `app/lib/actions/auth-actions.ts`
*   **Impact:** The original implementation used a client-side redirect after successful login. This could be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability, potentially leading to session hijacking or phishing attacks if a malicious actor could control the redirect URL.
*   **Fix:** The client-side redirect was replaced with a server-side `redirect` call within the `login` server action in `app/lib/actions/auth-actions.ts`. This ensures that the redirect is handled securely on the server, preventing manipulation by malicious clients.

### 2. Misuse of SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY

*   **Location:** `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`
*   **Impact:** The `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` was incorrectly accessed in `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` using `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, which are intended for client-side public keys. This could potentially expose the sensitive secret key if not handled carefully.
*   **Fix:** The environment variable access in `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` was corrected to use `process.env.SUPABASE_URL` and `process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Users were instructed to ensure these non-public environment variables are correctly defined in `.env.local` for server-side access, while `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are used for client-side initialization.

### 3. Lack of Authorization Check in `deletePoll` Function

*   **Location:** `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts`
*   **Impact:** The `deletePoll` server action lacked an authorization check, allowing any authenticated user to delete any poll by simply knowing its ID. This is a critical data integrity vulnerability that could lead to unauthorized data deletion and denial of service.
*   **Fix:** An authorization check was implemented within the `deletePoll` function. This check now verifies that the authenticated user attempting to delete a poll is indeed the creator of that poll by comparing the `user_id` of the requesting user with the `user_id` associated with the poll in the database. If the user is not the owner, the deletion request is rejected.
